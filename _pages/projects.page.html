                This is a simple utility for music producers to find samples using YouTube's vast library of videos.
                Since its creation the tool has been featured on some of the most popular sampling/music websites&colon;

            <p>
                I'm a huge fan of

                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9WMNuyjm4w">Luke Mascat's talk</a>

                about a tabletop strategy game that was banned from his workplace.
                Not having a way to play this game myself, I decided to remake it, doing a small design deep dive
                on Discord bots as a medium for multiplayer games.

            <p>
                RhythmHQ was a project stemming from the idea of

                <a href="">Pirate Radio Stations</a>

                but with a focus on underground artists from different parts of the world. This was
                also around the time I discovered serverless architecture and thought it would be
                a fun way to learn more.
