A TOOL FOR WRITING

Rivit *(Finnish for 'lines')* is a minimal, line-based markup format meant to stay out of the writer's way.

QUICK REFERENCE

   UPPERCASE LINES ARE HEADERS

   # Lines can be commented out.

   Lines are paragraphs and can contain *italics*, **bolds**, {some-page local links}, or [www.some-url.com external links].
   Styles cannot be combined.

   . List items use '.' and can be styled like paragraphs.
   .. Sub items must have >= dots of the previous line.

   Code blocks are lines with matching indentation:

      int
      main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
         return 0;
      }

   Media can be embedded within the generated document like so:

   @ path/img.png optional alt text
   @ path/song.wav

   # Add pages to the generated navbar (can be placed anywhere)
   + foo
   + bar
   + baz

If you're curious, here's a [https://github.com/judah-caruso/rivit-zig reference implementation] for the parser.


SYNTAX DESCRIPTION

Each line is considered a new paragraph and blank lines are ignored. Paragraphs can be styled with *italics*, **bolds**, {index local links}, and [https://judahcaruso.com external links].

   *Italics* are written like so.

   *Bolds* are written like so.

   Local {links} are written like so.
      'links' is expected to be a 'links.riv' file.

   [https://some-url.com External links are written like so].
      They're expected to open a new tab.

   Styles cannot be combined. For example:
      ***this*** will NOT generate bold-italics.
      [https://foo.bar *this*] will NOT generate an italic link.


Lines starting with '#' will not be included in the final output. This is useful for comments.

   # This line is excluded
   This line is included.


Lines with matching indentation are treated as code blocks. Rivit has no notion of syntax highlighting.

   This is not code.

      // This is code
      int main(void) {
         return 0;
      }

   This is also not code.


Lines containing no capital letters are treated as headers. This is different from Markdown where '#' gives you control over the size of the header. In Rivit, headers are the same size. However, a small exception is made if the first line output is a header: it will be treated as a title and made larger than subsequent headers.

   THIS IS A TITLE

   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod...

   I'M A HEADER & CAN CONTAIN SPECIAL CHARACTERS

   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod...


Lines starting with '.' are treated as list items. Subsequent lines with an equal number of dots are considered part of the same list. Subsequent lines with a greater number of dots are considered sub-lists of the previous line.

   SHOPPING LIST

   . Cleaning
   .. Soap
   .. Mop
   .. Broom

   . Cooking
   .. Vegetables
   .. Fruit


Lines starting with '@' are used to embed media within the generated document. Rivit has no notion of acceptable media types.

   Here's an image:

   @ img/file-path.png Alt text for the image (can be excluded)

   Here's some music:

   @ mus/file-path.wav


Lines starting with '+' are used to specify **local** links we'd like to reference but don't mention in the body of the page. This is useful for generating a navbar for wiki-style sites. Note: when generating navbars, links added with '+' take precedence over local links included in the body of the page.

   # Hidden local links that to the navbar
   + foo
   + bar
   + baz
