Hi, my name is Judah Caruso and I like to make things, especially {language-for-productivity programming languages}. Below is a small set of questions you may or may not care about:


DO YOU HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA?

I try **not** to as much as possible, but I do have [https://twitter.com/judah_dev Twitter], [https://github.com/judah-caruso GitHub], and a very inactive [https://www.twitch.tv/judahcaruso Twitch].


WHAT LANGUAGES DO YOU USE?

I experiment with a lot of different programming languages (probably too many), but the ones that've stuck around are:

. [https://go.dev/ Go]
. [https://ziglang.org Zig]
. Scheme
. C# (for work)
. TypeScript (if I really have to)


WHAT'S YOUR SETUP?

It's gone through a lot of iterations over the years, but I've settled on:

. A new-ish Macbook
. Sublime Text, barebones with vintage mode

I've also been playing around with a stock install of [https://helix-editor.com Helix] since it has an interesting take on modal editing, similar to [https://kakoune.org Kakoune] (but not Unix only).


WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE NOT WRITING CODE?

I haven't done it in a while, but I used to produce music. That was my main focus for many years, and was a decently unsuccessful career while I scavenged for programming and writing gigs. These days I write short stories, repair typewriters (*I know...*), work on board game ideas, and study languages.


WHO/WHAT INSPIRES YOU TO MAKE?

Seeing others make things inspires the most. I get a lot of joy out of seeing what they've done and trying to replicate it without knowing the process; essentially learning through doing.
